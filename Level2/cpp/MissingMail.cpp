// Problem: Missing Mail
// You are the manager of a mail room which is frequently subject to theft. A
// period of N days is about to occur, such that on the ith day, the following
// sequence of events will occur in order:

//  1. A package with a value of V{i} dollars will get delivered to the mail
//     room (unless V{i} = 0, in which case no package will get delivered).
//
//  2. You can choose to pay C dollars to enter the mail room and collect all of
//     the packages there (removing them from the room), and then leave the
//     room.
//
//  3. With probability S, all packages currently in the mail room will get
//     stolen (and therefore removed from the room).

// Note that you're aware of the delivery schedule V{1..N}, but can only observe
// the state of the mail room when you choose to enter it, meaning that you
// won't immediately be aware of whether or not packages were stolen at the end
// of any given day.

// Your profit after the Nth day will be equal to the total value of all
// packages which you collected up to that point, minus the total amount of
// money you spent on entering the mail room.

// Please determine the maximum expected profit you can achieve (in dollars).

// Note: Your return value must have an absolute or relative error of at most
// 10^(-6) to be considered correct.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 4000
// 0 <= V{i} <= 1000
// 1 <= C <= 1000
// 0.0 <= S <= 1.0

// Solution
// Time Complexity: O(NÂ²)
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// Explanation: We use dynamic programming to solve this problem. For each day, we have
// two choices: either collect the packages or leave them. If we collect, we pay C dollars
// and get all the packages. If we leave them, there's a probability S that they'll be stolen.
// We use a 1D DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum expected profit up to day i.
// For each day, we consider all possible previous days when we might have last collected
// packages, and choose the option that maximizes our expected profit.
