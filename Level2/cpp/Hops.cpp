// Problem: Hops
// A family of frogs in a pond are traveling towards dry land to hibernate. They
// hope to do so by hopping across a trail of N lily pads, numbered from 1 to N
// in order.

// There are F frogs, numbered from 1 to F. Frog i is currently perched atop
// lily pad P{i}. No two frogs are currently on the same lily pad. Lily pad N is
// right next to the shore, and none of the frogs are initially on lily pad N.

// Each second, one frog may hop along the trail towards lily pad N. When a frog
// hops, it moves to the nearest lily pad after its current lily pad which is
// not currently occupied by another frog (hopping over any other frogs on
// intermediate lily pads along the way). If this causes it to reach lily pad N,
// it will immediately exit onto the shore. Multiple frogs may not
// simultaneously hop during the same second.

// Assuming the frogs work together optimally when deciding which frog should
// hop during each second, determine the minimum number of seconds required for
// all F of them to reach the shore.

// Constraints:
// 2 <= N <= 10^(12)
// 1 <= F <= 500,000
// 1 <= P{i} <= N - 1

Solution
Time Complexity: O(F)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Explanation:
This can be solved with a deceptively simple formula: N - min(P)
Here's the reasoning behind it:

Start with the more verbose form: F + (N - F - 1) - (min(P) - 1)

- The 'F' accounts for each frog taking 1 second to hop off once they reach the end.
- (N - F - 1) computes how many empty lily pads are between frogs and the end.
  We subtract F for the pads already occupied, and 1 for the last pad (which no frog actually lands on).
- min(P) - 1 is the number of pads before the earliest frog, representing idle time before hopping starts.

Example:
N = 7, F = 2, P = [3, 5] â†’ pond layout: [ . . A . B . . ]
The earliest frog is at position 3 (0-based index 2), so min(P) = 3.
Result = N - min(P) = 7 - 3 = 4 seconds.
