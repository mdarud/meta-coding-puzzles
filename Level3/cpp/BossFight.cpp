// Problem: Boss Fight
// There are N warriors, the ith of which has a health of H{i} units and can 
// deal D{i} units of damage per second. The are confronting a boss who has
// unlimited health and can deal B units of damage per second. Both the 
// warriors and the boss deal damage continuously - for example, in half a
// second, the bossdeals B/2 units of damage.

// The warriors feel it would be unfair for many of them to fight the boss at 
// once, so they'll select just two representatives to go into battle. One 
// warrior {i} will be the front line and a different warrior {j} will back
// them up. During the battle, the boss will attack warrior {i} until that
// warrior is defeated (that is until the boss has dealt H{i} units of damage to
// them), and will then attack warrior {j} until that warrior is also defeated,
// at which point the battle will end. Along the way, each of the two warriors
// will do damage to the boss as long as they are undefeated.

// Of course, the warriors will never prevail, but they'd like to determine the 
// maximum amount of damage they could deal to the boss for any choice of warriors
// {i} and {j} before the battle ends.

// Constraints:
// 2 <= N <= 500,000
// 1 <= H{i} <= 1,000,000,000
// 1 <= D{i} <= 1,000,000,000
// 1 <= B <= 1,000,000,000

// Solution:
// Time Complexity: O(N * T) â€” where T is typically small (number of iterations to converge to optimal pair).
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// Explanation:
// We precompute H[i] * D[i] for each warrior.
// We iteratively search for the pair that maximizes total damage,
// alternating the front-line warrior based on which pair improves the result,
// reducing full O(N^2) brute force to something much faster in practice.
