## Problem: Boss Fight
## There are N warriors, the ith of which has a health of H{i} units and can 
## deal D{i} units of damage per second. The are confronting a boss who has
## unlimited health and can deal B units of damage per second. Both the 
## warriors and the boss deal damage continuously - for example, in half a
## second, the bossdeals B/2 units of damage.

## The warriors feel it would be unfair for many of them to fight the boss at 
## once, so they'll select just two representatives to go into battle. One 
## warrior {i} will be the front line and a different warrior {j} will back
## them up. During the battle, the boss will attack warrior {i} until that
## warrior is defeated (that is until the boss has dealt H{i} units of damage to
## them), and will then attack warrior {j} until that warrior is also defeated,
## at which point the battle will end. Along the way, each of the two warriors
## will do damage to the boss as long as they are undefeated.

## Of course, the warriors will never prevail, but they'd like to determine the 
## maximum amount of damage they could deal to the boss for any choice of warriors
## {i} and {j} before the battle ends.

## Constraints:
## 2 <= N <= 500,000
## 1 <= H{i} <= 1,000,000,000
## 1 <= D{i} <= 1,000,000,000
## 1 <= B <= 1,000,000,000

## Solution:
## Time Complexity: O(N * T) â€” where T is typically small (number of iterations to converge to optimal pair).
## Space Complexity: O(N)
## Explanation:
## We precompute H[i] * D[i] for each warrior.
## We iteratively search for the pair that maximizes total damage,
## alternating the front-line warrior based on which pair improves the result,
## reducing full O(N^2) brute force to something much faster in practice.
