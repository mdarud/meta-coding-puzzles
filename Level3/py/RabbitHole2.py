## Problem: Rabbit Hole 2
## You're having a grand old time clicking through the rabbit hole that is your
## favorite online encyclopedia.

## The encyclopedia consists of N different web pages, numbered from 1 to N.
## There are M links present across the pages, the ith of which is present on
## page A{i} and links to a different page B{i}. A page may include multiple
## links, including multiple leading to the same other page.

## A session spent on this website involves beginning on one of the N pages,
## and then navigating around using the links until you decide to stop. That is,
## while on page i, you may either move to any of the pages linked to from it,
## or stop your browsing session.

## Assuming you can choose which page you begin the session on, what's the
## maximum number of different pages you can visit in a single session? Note
## that a page only counts once even if visited multiple times during the
## session.

## Constraints:
## 2 <= N <= 500,000
## 1 <= M <= 500,000
## 1 <= A, B <= N
## A{i} â‰  B{i}

## Solution
## Time Complexity: O(N + M)
## Space Complexity: O(N + M)
## Explanation:
## - We model the encyclopedia as a directed graph with pages as nodes and links as edges.
## - We use Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components (SCCs), since within an SCC, we can traverse all nodes freely.
## - We build a new graph (a DAG) where each SCC becomes a node and links are added between SCCs.
## - We use dynamic programming over the topological order of this DAG to compute the maximum number of unique pages visitable.
## - The answer is the maximum DP value among all SCCs.
